# Jenkins-k8s
We are launching our CI/CD project series, aimed at providing a step-by-step guide to packaging a simple web application into a Tomcat Docker image and subsequently pushing the image to DockerHub.

Throughout this chapter, we will emphasize understanding the CI/CD process, rather than getting lost in the details of the respective plugins and tools. Our goal is to focus on the “why’s” and “how’s” behind each step.

Learning Objectives:

Develop a comprehensive understanding of the CI/CD process.
Avoid becoming overwhelmed by the technicalities of the plugins and tools involved.
Key Actions:

Deploy AWS EC2 instances to host Sonarqube, Jenkins, and Sonatype Nexus servers.
Set up a GitHub repository for code deployment and create a webhook to connect with the Jenkins server.
Configure essential Jenkins plugins and create a Jenkins pipeline project.
Recap the project and highlight key takeaways.
